        As you know, I’m not very good at expressing my feelings, but this is a
        little effort from me — I hope you’ll like it.
        <br />
        On your special day,I hope this year brings you everything you’ve ever
        wished for — success, happiness, and most importantly... me being less
        annoying to you (but thats  not the part -- I'll annoy you 😏)
        <br />
        Thank you
        for always being so supportive of me — you make me feel better whenever
        I’m down. You don’t know how much I care about you. Sometimes it’s just
        this feeling I can’t explain — the fear of losing you. I hope you feel
        the same love you’ve given me, because you truly deserve that and so
        much more. Your parents did an amazing job raising such a gentleman. You
        make me feel special, even with just by your words.Now without talking to
        you the day become so boring ..Thank you for always making my day better
        Wishing you a everlasting birthday with happiness and good health
        forever 💖 🌷💫
        <br />I was going to get you something special, but then I realized you
        already have me 😏
